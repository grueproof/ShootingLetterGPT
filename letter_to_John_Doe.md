Dear Mr. Doe,

I am writing to express my outrage at the gun violence that occurred in Anytown on 2023-05-01. This tragedy could have been prevented if our politicians had passed meaningful and substantive gun safety legislation.

I am imploring you to do everything in your power to pass gun safety legislation that will protect our citizens from gun violence. This is a matter of life and death, and we cannot afford to wait any longer.

Sincerely,

[Your Name]
